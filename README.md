This to serve as the place where I define **concepts**, **schemas** and **formats** for some of my applications (mostly, those that are on GitHub, and rely on databases). The **schemas** of my applications are going to be provided in the `./apps/` folder, whereas the the concepts will be either from wikidata.org, or (if I don't find that concept there) from this GitHub `./wiki/` ([view index](https://github.com/mindey/indb/wiki)).

The general pattern is, that the application structure is defined in a **MarkDown** (.md) file with snippets of **YAML** within it, representing JSON, and **anchors** are used to link to formats of the data types used in schemas.
